<p>If you need cell service, a restroom and paved footpaths, this book may not be for you.</p>

<p>But if you're up for a bit of adventure — even if it's just an armchair adventure — "Hiking from Portland to the Coast" may be the perfect inspiration.</p>

<p>The October 2016 book, by local history buff and longtime hiking enthusiast James D. Thayer, is a groundbreaking guide to 30 trails that crisscross through the lush forests that parallel Highway 26 to Seaside and Highway 6 to Tillamook.</p>

<p>From the Sauvie Island Loop to Banks-Vernonia Trail, Saddle Mountain to Humbug Mountain and beyond, Thayer spent years tracing a 50-mile corridor to the coast, recorded the trails with his GPS device, "then figured out how to get from one spider web to the next spider web," he says.</p>

<p>Much of the area is so remote, he was constantly on alert for bears and cougars, and brought a satellite beacon in case of emergency.</p>

<p>"In the seven years I was walking those trails, I ran into three people," who were hunting, says Thayer, who was the first president of Friends of Forest Park, in 1985. "There was two feet of snow, and they were surprised to run into me."</p>

<p>Thayer didn't start exploring on a whim. The project stemmed from the work of Friends of Forest Park in the 1980s, when they had a study funded to explore connections between Forest Park and the coast.</p>

<p>The study identified three routes, which he spent a decade mapping and then detailed in his 2008 book, "Portland Forest Hikes," and also keeps on his blog, www.foresthiker.com.</p>

<p>"Hiking from Portland to the Coast" picks up where the 2008 book left off, he says: "That book ends at Rocky Point Road out of Scappoose; this book starts there."</p>

<p>The book includes trails suitable for inexperienced as well as hardcore hikers.</p>

<p>He does offer a serious note of caution, and safety advice: "While Oregon is undoubtedly one of the most scenic states in the nation, it is also one of the most deadly when it comes to getting lost in the woods," he writes in his chapter titled "Five pieces of practical advice for the Oregon hiker."</p>

<p>Thayer has been past president of Oregon's World Affairs Council and currently serves on the Oregon Recreational Trail Advisory Council, Columbia Land Trust executive board and Salmonberry Trail Development Committee.</p>

<p>He's used his expertise to offer much more than just detailed, annotated maps. For each region, he weaves in stories of local lore, natural history and historical anecdotes — backstories of the Native Americans, white settlers, loggers and railroad operators who lived off the land.</p>

<p>During his research, he dug through original-source documents, such as oral histories and Chamber of Commerce pamphlets.</p>

<p>In a digitized version of The Astorian newspaper from 1903, he found an announcement of a 50-year golden anniversary, in which the couple had met in Rainier and connected through serendipity.</p>

<p>"In 1853 Rainier and many of the other towns along the Lower Columbia were too small to support a church or engage a priest on a permanent basis," Thayer writes. "If they needed one, they hired someone to come downriver from Portland. And while they were at it, they hired the band, and soon a Portland steamer was fully loaded with friends and strangers all intent on putting on one hell of a hullabaloo."</p>

<p>He continues, "In those days, it was the river that connected people, and the paddle-wheelers would churn their way back and forth across the river tying together communities on opposite sides of the river like the laces of a boot. Zigzagging down the river, the steamer stopped at Scappoose, Kalama, St. Helens, Goble, and Cowlitz, loading up with scores of eager celebrants."</p>

<p>Just how does one become a modern-day backcountry trailblazer? Thayer grew up in Germany, on his father's hunting reserve. As a child, he spent his time identifying animals and the size of their herds, so he credits his "built-in woods skills."</p>

<p>However, hiking in this region is like nowhere else in the world, he stresses throughout the book.</p>

<p>"In the Pacific Northwest, timber is harvested by pulling it up the slope to a landing pad built at the top of the ridge or mountain," he explains. "That means that all major roads in the forest run along the heights. To find people and roads you must ascend the slopes, not descend them."</p>

<p>If you don't take away anything else from Thayer's book, you'll surely get his overarching point: It's not about the destination; it's about the journey.</p>
