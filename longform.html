<div class="top"> JAPANESE GARDEN BLOOMS </div>
<div class="subtop"> Village to open April 2nd </div>
<div class="written">Written by Jennifer Anderson</div>

<div class="text3">
	<p>Known for its lavish spring cherry blossoms and brilliant fall color, the Portland Japanese Garden will celebrate the grand opening of its $33.5 million expansion and remodel effort.</p>

<p>The Cultural Village project kicked off in fall 2015 with a fundraising campaign, the garden's first-ever renovation since opening in 1963.</p>

<p>Starting Sunday, April 2, the new space is open to the public — having added 3.4 acres of usable space to the 9.1-acre property — and sure to boost what's already one of Portland's top attractions for locals and international visitors alike.</p>

<p>"In this increasingly plugged-in, distracted world, we find many of our guests seek out the peace and respite they find within the garden," says Steve Bloom, the garden's chief executive officer. "With this new Cultural Village, we will extend the garden's legacy and purpose, providing a heightened sense of tranquility, a more robust educational experience and preservation of significant cultural traditions and art forms."</p>

<p>Kengo Kuma, the world-renowned architect who also is spearheading the National Stadium for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, says that designing the Cultural Village through a combination of locally sourced materials and Japanese craftsmanship has been a singular experience.</p>

<p>"Given its proximity to nature, Portland is unlike any place in the world," he says. "This new Cultural Village serves as a connector of the stunning Oregon landscape, Japanese arts and a subtle gradation to architecture."</p>

<p>Working with the garden has influenced his approach to future projects, especially integrating green and wood, he also said. "For example, the National Stadium in Tokyo will be rich in vegetation, evoking a feeling of forest in the city," he says.</p>

<p>So what is new for visitors at the Portland Japanese Garden, exactly? Here are the top five things to see when you go:</p>

<div class="caption"> The courtyard of the new expansion.</div>

<p>1. New buildings</p>

<p>Three new buildings are open to visitors, each LEED-certified with its own living roof to absorb rainwater and prevent water runoff. Kuma designed the roofs with a nod to the thatched roofs of fishing huts from centuries ago in Japan.</p>

<p>The Jordan Schnitzer Japanese Arts Learning Center is home to new gallery spaces, a multipurpose classroom, the garden gift store and the Vollum Library, a comprehensive resource on Japanese gardening and related arts. A new Garden House will offer horticulture workshops.</p>

<p>2. Umami Cafe</p>

<p>This brand-new cafe will feature teas and products from Jugetsudo, a Japan-based tea cafe whose shops in Tokyo and Paris also were designed by Kuma. Built with Port Orford cedar and Tyvek, which emulates rice paper, the cafe appears to float over the hillside at the east side of the Cultural Village, with views of nature outside its windows. Japanese-style refreshments will also be served. </p>

<p>3. Castle wall</p>

<p>This authentic, medieval castle wall, at the west end of the Cultural Village, is a sight to behold. It's 185 feet long and 18.5 feet high, designed by Suminori Awata, a 15th-generation Japanese master stonemason. It was built using traditional hand tools and techniques, and uses 800 tons of Baker Blue granite from a quarry outside Baker City.</p>

<p>4. Three new gardens</p>

<p>Marvel at the new entry garden upon your arrival, with its cascading ponds and a water terrace at the entry in Washington Park. Also look for the tiny new urban garden, or tsubo niwa (courtyard garden), in the Tateuchi Courtyard, and the Ellie M. Hill Bonsai Terrace.</p>

<p>The existing Bill de Weese Chabana Research Garden, which evokes an alpine meadow in the Cascade Mountains, will grow native Japanese wildflowers to be cultivated for the garden's tea ceremony demonstrations. It's the first garden of its kind in North America.

<p>5. Learning space</p>

<p>Visitors will get to fully soak up the Japanese culture through exhibits, lectures and weekly demonstrations in the new spaces.</p>

<p>The three major exhibits this year will include a celebration of tea culture in the art and life of Hosokawa Morihiro, a former Prime Minister of Japan (this spring); an exploration of kabuki performances this summer; and a look at handcarved masks and traditional silk looms this winter.</p>

<p>Still underway — set to open in 2018 — is the International Institute for Japanese Garden Arts & Culture, which will offer apprentice-based learning in activities like Japanese gardening, tea ceremony and calligraphy.</p>

<p>The Portland Japanese Garden, 611 S.W. Kingston Ave., is open this season starting April 2 from noon-7 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.</p>
