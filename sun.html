<p>Portland Public Schools is in transitionâ€”again.</p>

<p>As students and teachers prepare to welcome new superintendent Donyall Dickey from Atlanta this summer, three out of seven seats on the Portland Public Schools Board are up for grabs. No incumbent is running for re-election, and none of the other four remaining board members has served for more than two years.</p>

<p>On May 16, voters will decide who among the 11 candidates for the school board to add to this mix. To help inform their decisions, the Portland Tribune asked the top two candidates in each of the three races to take us to places that illustrate why they're running.</p>

<p>Here are their answers. Although candidates for the Portland Public Schools board must come from certain zones in the district to run, voters districtwide cast ballots in all of the zones.</p>
